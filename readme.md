Trials of the Valar is a window application that allows users to enter quotes, sentences, or paragraphs and it will classify the level of corruption present in the phrase. It uses a naive bayes text classification algorithm that has been trained using excerpts from J.R.R. Tolkien's Silmarillion.

Classes of quotes
0 - uncorrupted
1 - minor corruption
2 - major corruption
3 - pure malice
